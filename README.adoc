= Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite Wrapped in Tauri

== Purpose:
----
To demonstrate an issue seen in using auto resize for the map.
----

=====
You must provide a token, a field is availible in the map header. You can track it through the emit: header -> map view -> mainStore.mapToken -> mapModal -> Mapbox

To test: Submit token and select a location from the dropdown. 

To disable 'auto resizing', comment out lines `83` and `110` in `Mapbox.vue`. Open the map after refreshing and submitting a token, drag a corner of the window to trigger resize.
If the window is resized while the `flyTo` animation is still active, the center of the animation will still be centered in the old map dimensions
